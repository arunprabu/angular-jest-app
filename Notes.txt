  * Developers must Prepare Test Cases 
    1. add should receive only numbers as inputs 
    2. add should return only number as output 
    3. ADD button should be disabled if invalid inputs (other than numbers) entered

  Feature: add 
  ----
    function add(a: number, b: number): number {
      return a + b;
    }

    add(10, 20); // 30

Modern Software Dev Methodologies as of 2024 / Testing Approaches 
------
  1. Test-Driven Development (TDD)
      * is a programming practice that instructs devs to write NEW CODE only if an automated test has failed

      Dev writes test cases => (Instant Feedback of Failure) => dev writes functionality => (Instant Feedback of Success) => [CODE COMPLETED]

      Testing Pattern: AAA (Arrange, Act, Assert)
      Tools: JEST, Mocha and Chai 

  2. Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)
      * is an agile dev Methodology 
      * an app is documented and designed around the Behavior the end users want to experience 
      
      Dev writes test cases => (Instant Feedback of Failure) => dev writes functionality => (Instant Feedback of Success) => [CODE COMPLETED]

      Testing Pattern: Given, When, Then 
      Tools: Jasmine JS


Devs write test cases => Devs write functionality => (Tools) => [Success] => Deployment 

============================
Automated Testing 
-----------------
  Levels of Testing 
  -----------
    0. Static Type Checking 
        Tools: TypeScript

    1. Unit Testing [TO LEARN]
        * Testing small independent unit of a component or other building block
        * Testing the building block in isolation (w/o connecting to rest api or service)
        * Individual units would be tested in the building blocks 
        * Bug Reduction Density: 40-80% 

        Tools: 
          JEST JS (Framework and a test runner)  ---- [TO LEARN]
          Jasmine JS (Framework) & Karma (Test Runner)   ---- [NOT LEARNING THIS]
          
    2. Integration Testing
        * Different Units, modules, components tested as combined entity
        * Behavior of the app would be tested 
        * To expose issues in the integration of multiple units 

        Example: testing if the child component can update parent component

        Tools:  
          JEST JS (Framework and a test runner)  
          Jasmine JS (Framework) & Karma (Test Runner)

    3. End to End (E2E) Testing
        * Testing the whole app 
        * multi-step tests combining multiple unit and integration tests into one big test 
        * Usually mocked or stubbed very little 
        * Tests are done in a simulated Browser
        * there may or may not be an UI while the test is running 
        Example: Testing the complete authentication flow 

        Tools: Protractor or CypressJS or Selenium or Puppeteer or Playwright

How to write the test cases? 
  AAA Pattern with JEST Syntax
Where to write?  
  in the spec.ts file
How to test our app against the identified test cases?
  ng test 

==============

Integrating JEST in Angular App
===========
  Step #1: 
    Let's install the necessary packages 

    npm i --save-dev jest jest-preset-angular @types/jest
